public class AddTwoNumbers {
    /*
    You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse
    order, and each of their nodes contains a single digit. Add the two numbers and return the sum as a linked list
    that matches the pattern above (digits in reverse order). You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading
    zeros, unless the number is exactly equal to 0.

    Ex 1:
    Input: l1 = [2, 4, 3], l2 = [5, 6, 4]
    Output: [7, 0, 8]
    Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807

    Ex 2:
    Input: l1 = [0], l2 = [0]
    Output: [0]

    Ex 3:
    Input: l1 = [9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9], l2 = [9, 9, 9, 9]
    Output: [8, 9, 9, 9, 0, 0, 0, 1]
